# churn-prediction
Description:
This project builds a machine learning model to predict customer churn using the Kaggle dataset.
The data is preprocessed by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.
A Random Forest Classifier is trained to classify whether a customer is likely to churn or not.
The model is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
This helps businesses proactively identify at-risk customers and improve retention strategies.
